To Run:

1. You will need the SDL2 library [installed](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).
2. Inside the terminal run ```make```. (Note: I developed this on  a linux system so you may need to configure your terminal on Windows) 

When you Maze Generator Window appears, enter 'g' on your keyboard to generate the maze, then enter 's' for the maze path to appear.
